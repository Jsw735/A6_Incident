We have 4 materials we need to ship out using the ZSCDTRK replacement, Create Outbound Delivery Without Order Reference.  When we are filling out the Ship-to-party for materials, we are sending them out to suppliers to repair.  But the only things selectable are customers, no suppliers (the supplier are the ones that repair parts and receive waste disposal shipments).  

The main thing we need to be able to do is the following:
Create a delivery with a BOL print out for the shipment.  Enter weights/route/etc.  Use E2Open to tender a truck to pick up the load from any site.  Pack and PGI when the truck arrives.  For repaired parts, tender truck to deliver load back to plant and perform a goods receipt to place back in stock.

Afternoon!   Just received email from ISI notifying me no PO yet, went back to req and realized I had not added the agreement number to the req! Looked up in ME3L with new supplier code from crossover-mapping spread sheet. Now I am receiving this error: attachment 1. 
Upon further investigation, noticed the new agreement for ISI is written in ZVA as opposed to AU, as seen here:(attachment 2)
Is this the cause of my error message? Or is this an issue with this req being written directly in ME51N as opposed to being spawned from a work order?

Issue:
Debit and Credit Memo tiles allow users to recall submissions for approval.
Once recalled, users enter change mode, enabling them to create billing documents without re-approval.
This bypasses the required independent review and approval, creating an audit compliance risk.
Audit Concern:
To meet requirements, all debits and credits are to be reviewed and released by someone other than the creator.
The current process in S/4 allows for self-approval, which violates segregation of duties.
Recommendation:
Default to a billing block on all debit and credit memos.
Ensure the billing block cannot be removed by the document creator.
Essentially, reinstate the control that existed in ECC, which satisfied audit requirements.",Project Related,FALSE,SAP S4/HANA,SAP IT Governance,7/24/2025 10:10,Chesterfield

RE CAT PR not converting, i did one of them with the Variant that is in the batch job that should pick it up, and it did.
 
My suspicion, that there is a fly in the ointment when the entire list is considered, because the variant is creating new PO per plant per contract.  some other data on the PR list for that (those) contract(s) could be bad an stopping the PO from being made (1 per contract per plant)

For some reason we’re not seeing OH Absorption being recorded for Flake Lactam (10071192) production in July. There are many Process Orders but below is an example of one. They all are coming out the same way. We are missing about $300k of absorption based what we know to have been the Flake production in July. Can you take a look? I don’t think this is a UoM issue since the 24,000 Kg of production converts to 52,911 Lbs and the OH Rate is $.068/lb. Is these possibly something with the way the POs are being confirmed? Let me know if easier to hop on the phone.

Have a critical issue.  

Not sure why doing this, but when we are converting to lbs for AS, we are only using the first two decimal places in the math. We need to use true weight in tons * 2000. We put the fix in 7/11 below and not using the right weight.  

Example –
Correct way
98.85 * 2000 = 197.700 

we are doing
98*2000 = 196,000

We have four cars getting rejected at Canadian border right now due to this.

I will put ticket, but see email attached. We need to correct asap. How long will this take to fix?
