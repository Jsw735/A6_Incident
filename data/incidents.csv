I was trying to order from the catalog app in S4.  I had reached the Purchase Request page after the system transferred me from the catalog app.
 
What transaction code or Fiori app were you using? I was using the ""Creata Purchase Requistion"" app tile that I added to my Fiori dashboard.

What error message did you receive (if any)?  the error message I received was a ""back-end error""

Are other users experiencing the same issue?  I don't know if anyone else is having this issue.
 
Have you done this task successfully before in S/4, or is this your first attempt?  I have been unable to get any catalog or purchase requistion requests through the entire process so far.  there have been multiple problems with the system.
 
Can you reproduce the issue? If yes, what are the steps?  I have attempted the process multiple times.  This is the first time I have gotten this far in the process without other issues first.  I forwarded my previous attempts to other departments for assistance.  The steps are:
1.I log into S4 Fiori to reach my dashboard
2.I click on the PR tile which pulls up the initial PR request page.  I click on the catalog icon and I am taken to the catalog page.
3.In this particular incidence I choose Runco catalog and I am redirected to the Runco catalog as normal
4.When i search for an item via part number I get the correct item with price.  I put that item in my cart.
-However if I search for another item, the item comes up but I am not given a price
-Instead the Runco catalog tells me that I must login into my account to see a price.  I don't have a login
-In this particular incident I choose only one item.  
-When I tried to submit my cart I was redirected to the Purchase Requistion page.
-The Material column on the PR page was blank as usual.
-I tried to search for the correct material category and that is when I got the ""back-end error"" message.

What is the document number, user ID, or material number (if applicable)?

Did you try clearing your browser cache or switching to another browser (for Fiori)? Troubling shooting so far:
Restarted and updated my laptop
I don't have access to Google Chrome on this laptop, it is due for an upgrade, but none were available
I tried to launch Chrome but it asks for a log in and I am not aware of having a log in

Is this urgent or time-sensitive? What's the business impact?  Yes, this urgent, we are running out of several critical supplies, and I need to be able to order them as soon as possible.

I confirmed that this is not a training issue. The manager knows how to approve purchase requisitions in S4HANA. But when he tried to approve a PR, he gets an error message that he is not authorized to approve the PR. This is a profile set up issue. His profile in S4HANA needs to be updated to allow him to approve purchase requisitions. I am routing this ticket to IT Leadership as per my discussion with Jenna.

I worked with Christopher on looking up sales orders and credit memos in S4HANA. Christopher uses Dynamics 365 to find sales orders and credit memos he has to process as part of his role in handling customer complaints. He takes the sales orders and displays them in the Display Sales Order app. And he also displays credit memos in the Display Credit Memos app. None of the sales orders or credit memos he found in Dynamics 365 would display in the Fiori apps. The system says they do not exist. I found out from Danae that sales order numbers in ECC were converted in S4HANA by adding a ""A"" prefix to the sales order numbers. I shared this with Christopher. But the sales orders showing in Dynamics 365 do not have the ""A"" prefix although all sales orders were converted. I spoke with Jenna Snook about this, as she knows Dynamics 365. She is looking into this issue with sales orders showing in Dynamics 365. She told me to reassign this ticket to her. She will follow up and then advise Christopher on what she find outs.

Waiting for CES team or the Reply consultant to walk through the step-by-step processes in both /AIF/ERR  and SRT_MONI that end users need to be trained on. There is a document, which is attached, that provides detailed information on using both processes. But Christina Xavier advised that the CES Team needs more training beyond what is included in this document. Once the walk through is done, training content can be developed for the CES team.

I confirmed that this is not a training issue. The manager knows how to approve purchase requisitions in S4HANA. But when he tried to approve a PR, he gets an error message that he is not authorized to approve the PR. This is a profile set up issue. His profile in S4HANA needs to be updated to allow him to approve purchase requisitions. I am routing this ticket to IT Governance as per my discussion with Jenna.

We have 4 materials we need to ship out using the ZSCDTRK replacement, Create Outbound Delivery Without Order Reference.  When we are filling out the Ship-to-party for materials, we are sending them out to suppliers to repair.  But the only things selectable are customers, no suppliers (the supplier are the ones that repair parts and receive waste disposal shipments).  

The main thing we need to be able to do is the following:
Create a delivery with a BOL print out for the shipment.  Enter weights/route/etc.  Use E2Open to tender a truck to pick up the load from any site.  Pack and PGI when the truck arrives.  For repaired parts, tender truck to deliver load back to plant and perform a goods receipt to place back in stock.

INC0118055

-Colleague called in because he's still having issue approving purchase requisition in S4 HANA.
-When he's trying to approve it, it doesn't show his people.
-Advised colleague that the issue has been forwarded to the internal supports.
-Informed colleague to wait for an update from the internal supports.

07-10-2025 11:08:47 - Adam Burja (Work notes)
I showed Paul the Fiori app My Inbox that he needs to use to approve Purchase Requisitions in S4HANA. He can access the app. However, purchase requisitions are being routed to him from individuals where he is not the approver. And the purchase requisitions for the people for which he is the approver are not being sent to him. So, his SAP profile relating to PR approvals needs to be fixed so that he is only getting PRs to approve from the people for which he is the approver. I am rerouting this ticket to SAP IT Governance, so the ticket can be forwarded to the correct team that manages SAP profiles.

07-09-2025 11:25:31 - Jelomhar Santos (Work notes)
-Colleague called in because he can't access the file in S4 HANA.

I showed David the Fiori app My Inbox that he needs to use to approve Purchase Requisitions in S4HANA. He can access the app. However, purchase requisitions are being routed to him from individuals where he is not the approver. And the purchase requisitions for the people for which he is the approver are not being sent to him. So, his SAP profile relating to PR approvals needs to be fixed so that he is only getting PRs to approve from the people for which he is the approver. I am rerouting this ticket to SAP IT Governance, so the ticket can be forwarded to the correct team that manages SAP profiles.

Hasan, i need more information on this, because currently we are sending only weight in TON.

07-10-2025 11:47:51 - Saverio Tranquilli (Work notes)
Assigned to Kedar. The logic in CPI hasn't changed and is driven by S/4.

Weights are transmitting in tons and needs to be pounds, otherwise billing will fail. I checked a few of the payloads we've been getting in CPIsome are using LB as the unit of weight, and others are using TON. We don't need to make any changes in CPI since the logic comes from S/4. If S/4 sends LB, we send LB to Bourque; if it sends TON, we send TON to BDS. @Tingrikar, Kedar will advise if any changes can be made in S/4 to handle this.



Also, for shipments manually billed, is there a way to not transit again, suppress output to BDS? This will need to be addressed in S/4. @Tingrikar, Kedar, please advise.

Not all deliveries are coming out from S/4 with a LOADID. For example, delivery 80003453 includes a LOADID, while 80003672 does not. For those deliveries with a valid LOADID, the data has been transmitted correctly to E2OPEN via CPI. Further investigation is needed in S/4 to understand why this field is not being transmitted for all order statuses.

Talked this through with Nadim, Andrew and Hasan. Here is the approach we will take:
1.  Amy to configure/update configuration to drive outputs to specific partner functions
     Example: Y1 partner function will be for Invoices whereas Q1 is for COA
     Master Data: Create email recipients as Business Partners (People; Account Group = GPIN) in mass
     Contact Name can be generic if customer requires multiple people to get outputs emailed...
     Example: If Growmark has 5 people wanting to receive the invoice, BP name = Growmark Invoicing and we assign all 5 email addresses to that BP
2.  Assign as contact persons as a relationship to customer
      Assign as appropriate partner function
3.  Enhancement to send email to ALL emails associated to the output

From Dottie: 
1 - This is used when A6 arranges trucks for packaged material
2 - The BOL appears within minutes of creating the BOL
3 - Output is triggered when the BOL is created.
 
This is the only one I have had an issue with and in looking at the order all is correct. I just can't get this one come over to TMS

Afternoon!   Just received email from ISI notifying me no PO yet, went back to req and realized I had not added the agreement number to the req! Looked up in ME3L with new supplier code from crossover-mapping spread sheet. Now I am receiving this error: attachment 1. 
Upon further investigation, noticed the new agreement for ISI is written in ZVA as opposed to AU, as seen here:(attachment 2)
Is this the cause of my error message? Or is this an issue with this req being written directly in ME51N as opposed to being spawned from a work order?  
 
I believe I should re-write requisition attached to a work order and see if that solves problem, but I am very skeptical about that ZVA unit being used in the ""new"" agreement. 
please advise as vendor is awaiting payment, thank you!","Training","false","SAP S4/HANA","SAP IT Governance","09-18-2025 14:32:35","Chesterfield","09-18-2025 09:42:11 - James Burrows (Work notes)

When trying to cancel part of a reservation using a Material Document Number, you cannot change the qty. The qty's are grayed out. It will not let you do a partial reversal this way.

If you try to cancel/reverse an item using the reservation number itself, but change the movement to a 202, it does not pull up the already issued out qty's for that reservation to be able to reverse them. Instead, if there is a backorder of items on that reservation, it pulls them up and the 201 movement is locked in on the drop box below. It does not allow you to change that movement type in the drop box below.

Issue:
Debit and Credit Memo tiles allow users to recall submissions for approval.
Once recalled, users enter change mode, enabling them to create billing documents without re-approval.
This bypasses the required independent review and approval, creating an audit compliance risk.
Audit Concern:
To meet requirements, all debits and credits are to be reviewed and released by someone other than the creator.
The current process in S/4 allows for self-approval, which violates segregation of duties.
Recommendation:
Default to a billing block on all debit and credit memos.
Ensure the billing block cannot be removed by the document creator.
Essentially, reinstate the control that existed in ECC, which satisfied audit requirements.","Project Related","false","SAP S4/HANA","SAP IT Governance","07-24-2025 10:10:26","Chesterfield","07-21-2025 13:19:50 - Jenna Snook (Work notes)

RE CAT PR not converting, i did one of them with the Variant that is in the batch job that should pick it up, and it did.
 
My suspicion, that there is a fly in the ointment when the entire list is considered, because the variant is creating new PO per plant per contract.  some other data on the PR list for that (those) contract(s) could be bad an stopping the PO from being made (1 per contract per plant)

hi Jenna, the 2 tickets you assigned to me from Abhishek's queue belong to him - that's why I reassigned them to him, I would have had to work with him one what happened with those objects as it is.  he's on vacation this week, but will be back on Tuesday.  I roll off the project tomorrow, so will reassign those tickets back to him.

Updating assignment to Maheshwaran to update CMIR over/under delivery tolerance values for sales org 1003

Confirmed with CES SMEs - only sales org 1003 requires updates. Customers/open sales orders set to over/under of 10/1. 
CMIR pending path forward as there is no MASS object to update CMIR tolerances. Placing ticket on hold due to CMIR decision.

Business disagreement on overall tolerances to be set. Putting ticket on hold until business can make a decision.

09-04-2025 10:24:24 - Amy Madden (Work notes)
Without having any examples to look at, this is likely a training issue. For customer facing deliveries, delivery tolerances are driven from master data. It can be set (in this order) via CMIR record, Ship-to or sold-to. Controls has us setting this to 50% for both over and under tolerances. It can be adjusted at time of order entry, but isn't typical.

Are other users experiencing the same issue? Not sure
Have you done this task successfully before in S/4, or is this your first attempt? N/A
Can you reproduce the issue? If yes, what are the steps? Yes, try to sign in to BPC in excel, password change request message pops up, hit ""OK"", web page opens up to change password and asks you to sign in, try to sign in, then the site error occurs.
What is the document number, user ID, or material number (if applicable)? N/A
Did you try clearing your browser cache or switching to another browser (for Fiori)? N/A, site opens on it's own and this is not an S4 issue.
Is this urgent or time-sensitive? What's the business impact? I need the access fix today if possible or by tomorrow morning at the latest. This login is necessary to run financial reports for month end close reconciliations that are time-sensitive.

POs are still being migrated into S4, as users are still finding POs that needed conversion but had not been identified in Cutover.  The external number range is used for this purpose.

For some reason were not seeing OH Absorption being recorded for Flake Lactam (10071192) production in July. There are many Process Orders but below is an example of one. They all are coming out the same way. We are missing about $300k of absorption based what we know to have been the Flake production in July. Can you take a look? I dont think this is a UoM issue since the 24,000 Kg of production converts to 52,911 Lbs and the OH Rate is $.068/lb. Is these possibly something with the way the POs are being confirmed? Let me know if easier to hop on the phone.

Have a critical issue.  

Not sure why doing this, but when we are converting to lbs for AS, we are only using the first two decimal places in the math. We need to use true weight in tons * 2000. We put the fix in 7/11 below and not using the right weight.  

Example 
Correct way
98.85 * 2000 = 197.700 

we are doing
98*2000 = 196,000

There was not a Plant Selection pop up for the S4 catalogs.  The S4 equallevel client was set to over-write the Marketplace user accounts to Amines.  EL removed this feature.  Now the EL User Accounts can be updated by the Marketplace Admin, and will not be over-written.  The User Plant will then appropriately determine the sets of catalog by plant / region.

There are (3) H8202NLB-TNK lots that have process orders and HUs showing ~47 lbs instead of ~47k lbs. It looks like someone is putting a decimal in instead of a comma
Ive outlined the batch# / Process order# / HU#s for these 3 that Ive found thus far. These need to be fixed.

Short term solution, update shipping condition on ship to party to 07 (this customer's ship to is 07 regularly).

Price at PGI billing block is driven by KVGR3 field. It currently places a billing block at header level if and only if there is a dummy price.

Changes to be made:
--Billing blocks have to be item level due to having multiple delivery dates per order. In ECC this was done at each delivery.
--PGI block must be applied regardless of if there is a dummy price or not
--Delayed Billing Dashboard will have to be updated based off the first item
